# Fun bash stuff

Each folder in this repo contains a different bash script (or similar), that integrates a new function or improves a regular one in .bashrc.
This was done during bored times at university, so no garantee is given for elegance or usefulness of said scripts.

## How to use:

Every command is documented in comments in the files themselves, so as not too make a README of a hundred pages.

## Errors?

Tell me and I'll do my best to correct them... At some point :D
